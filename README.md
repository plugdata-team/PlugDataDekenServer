# PlugDataDekenServer: Central Repository for Pd's Deken Server

Welcome to PlugDataDekenServer, the central hub for hosting all available packages for Pd's Deken server. Our mission is to provide a comprehensive collection of packages to enhance your experience with Pd (Pure Data).

## About the Updater Program
This branch houses the updater program, a vital component designed to keep our repository updated seamlessly. Although crafted with JUCE, we acknowledge that it might not be the optimal tool for the task. However, leveraging JUCE enables us to utilize the ValueTree binary output efficiently, ensuring a smooth and efficient update process.

## Why JUCE?
You might be wondering why we chose JUCE for this task. Despite its potential limitations, we opted for JUCE because of its versatility and the existing codebase developed for PlugData. By leveraging JUCE, we streamline development and ensure compatibility with various platforms, ultimately benefiting our users with a robust and reliable updater program.
