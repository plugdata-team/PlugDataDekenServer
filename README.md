# PlugDataDekenServer
Server that hosts all available packages for Pd's deken server.

This branch contains the updater program. This is made with JUCE, which is obviously not the best tool for the job, but I had already written the code for PlugData. OTOH, by using JUCE I can use the ValueTree binary output!
